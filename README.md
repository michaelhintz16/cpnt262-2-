# About 
* This s a Dynamic Image gallery. when you put the curser on the images they move up and a link appears at the bottom  that links to the authors unsplash page. Wheny ou click on the picture it links to the wiki page for the images 


# elements used 
*  For the Forloop what i used was the for (let i = 1; i < myImages.length; i++)
*  For the figures i used the DomElement method. 
*  created all the divs using docuemnt.createElement
*  used appendchild to run it all on the html page.
